This is a collection of source code for solutions to programming projects taken from a popular C++ textbook. They have been developed using Visual Studio Community 2013, targeting Windows 7 as a platform.

The purpose of this collection is to display my (Nic Terreri) ability to write correct C++ code, as well as my understading of good C++ programming practices.

At first, I started working on every single project presented at the end of each chapter of the textbook, about halfway through, I realized I was not going to have the time to finish the book before the start of my Master's Degree in Computer Science if I kept working on every single project.

Therefore, I thereafter started working on one project for every two, or on whichever project I found interesting. Notwithstanding the reduced work volume, I was unable to progress past chapter 11 before the begginning of my MSc course.

Needless to say, a few of the projects require some reworking. The projects implementing custom classes, for example, have very rough test driver main functions that are not very easy to understand; secondly, some of the early projects manifestly misuse recursion (although most projects should be fit to the task); finally, there is a more or less ubiquitous lack of documentation throughout.
