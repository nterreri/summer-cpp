This is a collection of source code for solutions to programming projects taken from a popular C++ textbook.
They have been developed using Visual Studio Community 2013, targeting Windows 7 as a platform.

The purpose of this collection is to display my (Nic Terreri) ability to write correct C++ code, as well as my understading of
good C++ programming practices specifically, and good programming practices generally.
