This is a collection of source code for solutions to programming projects taken from a popular C++ textbook.
They have been developed using Visual Studio Community 2013, targeting Windows 7 as a platform.

The purpose of this collection is to display my (Nic Terreri) ability to write correct C++ code, as well as my understading of
good C++ and object-oriented programming practices specifically, and good programming practices generally.

At first, I started working on every single project presented at the end of each chapter of the textbook, about halfway 
through, I realized I was not going to have the time to finish the book before the start of my Master's Degree in Computer 
Scienceif I kept working on every single project.

Therefore, I thereafter started working on one project for every two, or on whichever project I found interesting.
Notwithstanding the reduced work volume, I was unable to progress past chapter 11 before the begginning of my MSc course.
